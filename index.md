# Mortie's Knowledge Base

Welcome to my knowledge base. My name is Morteza Torabi - call me Mortie - I am a technology enthusiast, a software and DevOps engineer, a computer scientist, and a physicist.
Here I'll write down and categorize what I research and find interesting. This is the result of my actively learning and documenting new topics based on my understanding of different software engineering subjects. Not everything here would be organized and categorized in a step-by-step fashion but there would be many interesting tips that a fellow technology enthusiast might find useful.
