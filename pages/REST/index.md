[API-First, API Design-First, or Code-First: Which Should You Choose (stoplight.io)](https://blog.stoplight.io/api-first-api-design-first-or-code-first-which-should-you-choose#threedifferentapproaches)

### API-first design

**API first** is an approach to development in which your [APIs](https://www.akana.com/blog/what-is-an-api) are considered first-class citizens. This means that everything you’re developing is developed with the end goal of [API consumption](https://www.akana.com/blog/consume-apis) in mind. In API first development, APIs are no longer an afterthought — they’re a differentiator.

#### Plan Your API-First Program

[Understanding  the API-First Approach to Building Products (swagger.io)](https://swagger.io/resources/articles/adopting-an-api-first-approach/)

1. **Brainstorm -** First, it is necessary to identify key services your business offers and the capabilities of the business. Figure out the kinds of APIs that should be built and which services should be offered via APIs. Also, figure out and write down the use cases for each API. Write down potential endpoints based on those use cases.
2. **Establish API stakeholders -** Who are the stakeholders within your organization? As many people as possible should be involved in your API initiative – you need company-wide buy-in and a vision that is shared by teams within your organization. Also, allow stakeholders to weigh in on the design of the API. Stakeholders can then agree on interactions across the organization so that APIs remain consistent.
3. **Design an API contract -** The contract establishes a set of standards and best practices for designing APIs. Be sure to describe and document all APIs. Ensure that all APIs work the same, from endpoint names and URLs to error codes and versioning. Consistency is key. 
4. **Create a style guide -** A comprehensive, cohesive style guide ensures consistency across the teams of an organization that are building services. API status codes, versioning, error handling, and more will be standardized ensuring that APIs are designed the same way. Use a tool like SwaggerHub to [create a style guide](https://swagger.io/tools/swaggerhub/faster-api-design/) for all APIs across your organization.
5. **Implement API governance -** An API governance process can help enforce established standards and reinforce desired outcomes. We discuss [API governance](https://swagger.io/solutions/governance-and-standardization/) in an upcoming blog article. Conducting peer code reviews can also help ensure that API design standards are followed and that developers are producing quality code.
6. **Automate processes -** Use tools like SwaggerHub to automate processes like generating API documentation, style validation, API mocking, and versioning. Also, make APIs self-service so that developers can get started building apps with your APIs right away. Provide interactive documentation or a sandbox so that developers can try out API endpoints. 
7. **Track and manage your API portfolio -** Avoid duplicating code and building redundant APIs by tracking and managing your API portfolio. Implement a system that helps you track and manage your APIs. The larger your organization and platform becomes, the harder it gets to track APIs and their dependencies.
8. **Create a portal for internal developers -** Create a central place for internal developers, a place where everything for all your APIs is stored- API specification, documentation, contracts, etc. For example, PayPal has built a portal for its developers and it’s “one of the most visited internal apps in PayPal,” according to [an InfoQ article](https://www.infoq.com/articles/paypal-api-first-part1). PayPal’s portal includes an inventory of all APIs, documentation, dashboards, and more.
