#### SCTP protocol

Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a transport-layer protocol that ensures reliable, in-sequence transport of data. SCTP provides multihoming support where one or both endpoints of a connection can consist of more than one IP address. This enables transparent failover between redundant network paths.
